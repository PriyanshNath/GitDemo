    <p>
      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
      known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the
      only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all
      of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of
      Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which
      is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land
      hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by
      vegetation, while large ice sheets at Earth's polar polar deserts retain
      more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water
      combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which
      interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has
      a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting
      most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
